# KotlinExperiments
This repository is created while I am trying to learn Kotlin. I will try different features of the language and try to understand how this language works.

This repository maybe uses source code from various books for Kotlin but does not substitute any of them.
Yes, mostly from "Kotlin in Action"! Yes again, I know there is link (https://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Kotlin%20in%20Action/Chapter%201/1.1/1.1_ATasteOfKotlin.kt) to all the examples but I want to have fun writing my own examples sometimes (and your examples)
It is created just to practice my skills and I believe that this is a superb (ok, ok good) reference for anyone out there who needs to read Kotlin examples without purchasing any book.
If you have restricted free time to read a book, just read these examples (if you can!) and you will get a glimpse at Kotlin.

Before doing any negative criticism remember the following rules:
1. I am not an author. 
	I will not try to be one!
2. I am not a professional programmer. 
	That's why I still have a life. If I was a programmer I would have a life++!
3. You cannot write bad reviews. 
	It is open source. Instead of writing bad reviews, write some code to improve this!
4. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand!
5. There will be more rules in the future!
